- Feel free to read, study, and contribute additional resources.  
- If you find a broken link or outdated content, open an **issue** so it can be fixed.

## Policies for Updates & Contributions

To maintain organization and accuracy:

1. **Creating Issues**  
   - Open an issue for bugs, missing materials, or suggested improvements.  
   - Label issues appropriately (`bug`, `enhancement`, `learning-resource`, etc.).

2. **Updating Materials**  
   - Fork the repo and create a feature branch for your changes.  
   - Follow the same folder structure as existing materials.  
   - Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.  
   - Team leads will review and merge once approved.

3. **Commit Guidelines**  
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages (e.g., `Added checklist for SSH hardening`).  
   - Keep commits focused—one feature or fix per commit.

4. **Code & Document Standards**  
   - Scripts should have comments explaining their purpose.  
   - Markdown documents should use headings, lists, and code blocks for clarity.

## Communication & Support

- For questions about using the repo or checklists, open an issue with a proper label/tag.
